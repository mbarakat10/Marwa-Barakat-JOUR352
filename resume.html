      <h2>Experience</h2>
      
            <h3>News Staff Writer</h3>
            <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
            <h5>2022-present</h5>
            <p>I am responsible for pitching and writing one story a week. My beat is graduate student life and the Graduate Student Government, and I work to stay in contact with those sources, build connections and write about the issues most affecting this group of students. I am also responsible for picking up blogs when they come up and writing concise stories that are published within a few hours. During the midterm elections in 2022, I talked to voters at the polls about what issues were important to them in that election cycle.</p>
      
            <h3>Copy Editor</h3>
            <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
            <h5>2022</h5>
            <p>I worked two night shifts a week where I fact-checked numerous stories using online research, interview recordings and looking through news archives. I also worked to ensure stories lacked grammatical errors and AP style issues. Through this job, I was able to establish working relationships with reporters, and I learned how to work alongside them to produce the best work for the paper.</p>
      
            <h3>Scooper</h3>
            <h4>Bruster's Ice Cream</h4>
            <h5>Summer 2021 and 2022</h5>
            <p>I served clients through some of the busiest days of the year, including the Fourth of July. Through this job, I learned how to maintain a calm yet diligent attitude amid stressful situations. I also practiced communicating and building a relationship with a wide array of people in a friendly and helpful manner. I worked as a team member by doing my part in finishing orders and keeping the store organized, while also assisting my coworkers whenever needed.</p>
