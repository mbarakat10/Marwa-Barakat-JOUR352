    <h1>The Lack of Diversity in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism</h1>
    <h2>A visual representation of the diversity at the University of Maryland's journalism college</h2>
    <h3>By Marwa Barakat</h3>
    <p>Data from the University of Maryland portrays a severe lack of diversity at Merrill College, making it one of the least diverse colleges on campus. For over 10 years, the majority of undergraduate journalism students have been white. Although enrollment has slowly decreased over time, the number of white undergraduates is consistently greater than any other race.</p>
